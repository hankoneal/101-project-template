# Gas Price App

This free app will allow users to find nearby gas stations and see their gas prices so they can find the
cheapest gas price without driving to the actual gas station first.

Primary stakeholders will be workers or students that are commuting and don't necessarily have time to drive to or check gas station prices while driving. They will be able to quickly access an app that will show them, based off their zip code, gas prices in their current area.
